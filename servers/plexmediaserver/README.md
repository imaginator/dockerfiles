# docker-plexmediaserver

## Description

This is a Dockerfile to set up [Plex Media Server](http://www.plexapp.com/).

## Usage

### Building

Build the image with `docker build -t plexmediaserver .` in this directory.

### Running

Plex depends on Avahi and it's own GDM network discovery protocol to work so while there may be ways around this, the easiest way is probably to run the container on the same subnet as your LAN.

#### Set Up a Bridge on the Host

I used Ubuntu's [KVM networking guide](http://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Networking) to create a `br0` interface which is bridged to `eth0` and uses DHCP. If you want a similar setup, add the following to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```
auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
  bridge_ports eth0
  bridge_stp off
  bridge_fd 0
  bridge_maxwait 0
```

Now just restart networking (`service networking restart`) or reboot.

#### Running the Container Using the Bridge

Docker allows you to overwrite the container's LXC configuration using `-lxc-conf`. While this is an ugly hack, I took advantage of it to set up networking manually in the container. I completely disabled Docker's network management on the container with `-n=false`. The container stores all the Plex configuration in the `/data` directory, so it may be a good idea to create a bind mount with the host with `-v` for persistent storage.

#### Example

The following starts the plexmediaserver container with:

- The host's `/srv/media/videos` mounted inside the container's `/videos`
- The host's `/srv/media/music` mounted inside the container's `/music`
- No network management from docker (`-n=false`)
- Bridged networking using the `br0` bridge with an IP address of `192.168.0.10` and gateway of `192.168.0.1`

```
docker run -d -n=false \
  -v /srv/media/videos:/videos \
  -v /srv/media/music:/music \
  -v /tank/virt/data/plexmediaserver:/data \
  -lxc-conf="lxc.network.type = veth" \
  -lxc-conf="lxc.network.flags = up" \
  -lxc-conf="lxc.network.link = br0" \
  -lxc-conf="lxc.network.ipv4 = 192.168.1.10" \
  -lxc-conf="lxc.network.ipv4.gateway=192.168.1.1" \
  plexmediaserver
```

for nice presentation in Apache eg `plex.your-domain.com` add the `plex.imaginator.com.conf` file to your `/etc/apache2/site-avaliable/` and run `a2ensite`

to ensure the server runs when Ubuntu boots, add `plex-mediaserver-docker.conf` to `/etc/init/`

#### GUI Setup

* Now just navigate to [http://192.168.0.10:32400/web/](http://192.168.0.10:32400/web/) to set up Plex.
* set `http://plex.imaginator.com/web/index.html#!/settings/server` to `Server is mapped to port 32400`
